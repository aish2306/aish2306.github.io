I'm a third year PhD student at University of Delaware in Computer and Information Sciences department. I'm advised by
Dr. Matthew Louis Mauriello, and am a member of the Sensify Lab. Through my research, I aim to build technology-mediated interactions with the potential to potentially create a positive impact improve the quality of life  of individuals especially with mental health and health care systems.

My research focuses on understanding the lack of coping infrastructure to prevent stress and burnout, and therefore designing human-centric tools and approaches to mitigate these challenges. I often incorporate theories from various disciplines such as cognitive science, psychology and behavioral health and sciences to support better design of such technologies.
