I'm a first year PhD student at University of Delaware in Computer and Information Sciences department. I'm advised by
Dr. Matthew Louis Mauriello, and am a member of the Sensify Lab. Through my research, I aim to build new technologies which have the potential to create a positive impact in the lives of users and improve their quality of life through technology-mediated interactions with mental health and health care systems.

My research focuses on understanding the lack of coping infrastructure to prevent stress and burnout, and therefore designing human-centric tools and approaches to mitigate these challenges. I often incorporate theories from various disciplines such as cognitive science and behavioral health and sciences to support better design of such technologies.
